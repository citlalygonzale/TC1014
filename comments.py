#This is really simple to do the only thing you have to do
#is to put this symbol "#" and then python would ignore this
#you can write anything right here and this won't run

print("how to")#you can also put anything around here and it won't shows

print ("use comments")
 #the only thing that will show up is the printed ones lets see
